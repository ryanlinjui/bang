|              For example: If you already have a barrel, you can't play another one.                                            |

|              If you want to change your weapon, then play the new weapon card twice the switch to the new weapon.              |
|              (We design this double-check feature to prevent players to accident;y switch their weapons.)                      |
|                                                                                                                                |

|          A player's hand size limit depends on how much health he has, so remember keep as much health as you can              | 
|          to keep your advantage.                                                                                               |
