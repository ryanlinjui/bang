|              (We design this double-check feature to prevent players to accident;y switch their weapons.)                      |

|          to keep your advantage.                                                                                               |

|      These weapons can increase your shooting range, then you can damage enemies with further distance.                        |
|      You can only equip one weapon at a time, if you want to equip another weapon, you need to discard your old ones.          |
|      Remember, weapons do NOT change the distance between players, it only increase the maximize shooting range.               |
